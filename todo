# TASKS

* Create website banner images
* Create favicon
* Create concept art e.g. Wireframes, 
* Create Terms and Conditions, Privacy policy documents


# FEATURES ROADMAP

* Create/Save/Store Avatars
* RGB color palletes
* Default textures e.g. skin colours, freckles, hair colours, nails, hair styles, accessories, clothing, prosthetics, neural interfaces, handheld accessories
* Default meshes e.g. skinny, normal, overweight bodies
* Default animations
* Body dimension proportion manipulation - weight, height
* Transform the model with geometric options e.g. adding verticies, limbs etc., 
* Adding Meshs of non humanoids e.g. Pet's (dogs) - TBD
* Allow importing and grouping of meshs and textures from specific folders
* Allow linking of external websites to various parts of body
* Exporting 3D model to different formats
* Importing 3D model from different formats
* Photo modelling - Software accepts a photo of yourself, picture or model and converts into the software and converts to a model.
* Multiple models on field - Can add muliple models to field.
* API's - We aim to create API's to make the cyberware avatar avaialble for integrating with third party applications e.g. Social Media, Metaverse, Scientific, Gaming, etc.,
* Cytheseus - The theoertical aspects of how much the cyberware augmented to model effects body function. This will scale in from human to transhuman. With color ranges showing research articles of various effects documented on the human body. The various effects of studied polymers, voltage, magnetism on the body. Electrogram simulations increase and decrease based on proportions of implants used. How much humanity departs with more implants. How close you are from Transhumanism. As one metric goes up e.g. more neural prosthetics added to avatar, other metrics will react higher or lower
