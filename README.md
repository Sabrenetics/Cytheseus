## Abstract
Cytheseus, derived from Cybernetics and Theseus, amalgamates philosophical inquiry with ancient paradoxical musings. While Cybernetics delves into the study of systems encompassing man and machines, Theseus embodies the enigmatic Ship of Theseus, pondering over identity amidst perpetual reconstruction. Cytheseus bridges these domains, pondering the essence of humanity in an era of technologically augmented bodies. This paper introduces the concept of Cytheseus as a metric, quantifying the extent of human augmentation, akin to the Ship of Theseus's planks replaced over time. Through an exploration of Cyborgization, the paper investigates the convergence of organic and artificial components, elucidating its implications in science fiction and real-world innovations.

## Background

Cytheseus, envisioned as both a website and an online application, revolutionizes cyborg patient health record systems. Users can create, modify, and track their cyberware/cyborg implants by generating 3D avatar models of themselves and animals. Through Cytheseus, users can add, remove, and modify their avatar with different cyberware/cyborg parts, providing an accurate representation of themselves with metrics on various aspects.

Cytheseus serves as a groundbreaking platform for documenting vital health-related information regarding cyberware/cyborg implants. Users can access metrics such as Cytheseus score, electromagnetic interference, potential health problems (e.g., implant rejection rates, cancer rates, implant migration rates, infection rates), and the percentage of humanity they have left or are leaving behind. Additionally, Cytheseus provides information on places to obtain cyberware support, cyborg clinics, and laws applicable to cybernetically enhanced individuals, including travel restrictions and potential legal issues.

Moreover, Cytheseus facilitates collaboration and knowledge-sharing among users and companies. Users can create, upload, and share their cyberware parts, contributing to a rich ecosystem of revolutionary cyborg cyberware cybernetic part record keeping. With robust APIs, users can remotely target their implants and configure them online, directly updating the firmware on their implants within their bodies. This capability represents a significant advancement in remote implant management and personalization.

## Current alternatives
There is no clear alternative in the market that exists. Hence why Cytheseus was defined and created.

## Introduction
Cytheseus, a neologism born from the crossroads of Cybernetics and Theseus, seeks to navigate the complexities of human augmentation. Cybernetics, the study of systems, intertwines with the Ship of Theseus paradox, prompting reflection on the nature of identity amidst constant flux. In this paper, we embark on a journey to comprehend Cyborgization through the lens of Cytheseus, illuminating the blurred boundaries between man and machine.

## Cytheseus: Defining Human Augmentation
Cytheseus emerges as a conceptual framework, akin to a percentage, quantifying the extent of human augmentation. Drawing parallels to the Ship of Theseus, Cytheseus measures the proportion of replaced body parts, posing profound questions about the essence of humanity in a technologically driven world. Through hypothetical scenarios, we elucidate how Cytheseus varies based on the degree of augmentation, from minor enhancements to extensive biomechanical integration.

## Exploring Cyborgization
Building upon Cytheseus, we delve into Cyborgization as the process of integrating organic and artificial components to augment human capabilities. References from "The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction" underscore the multifaceted nature of Cyborgization, spanning from mental enhancements to radical biomechanical fusion. Through anecdotes from science fiction and real-world advancements, we unravel the intricate tapestry of Cyborgization, where the line between human and machine blurs with each innovation.

## Ethical Implications and Future Directions
As Cyborgization advances, ethical considerations loom large. Questions surrounding identity, autonomy, and societal norms demand careful deliberation. Moreover, as technology progresses, the possibilities for human augmentation expand exponentially, necessitating ongoing discourse and regulation. Looking ahead, Cytheseus serves as a compass, guiding ethical deliberations and shaping the trajectory of human enhancement.

## Conclusion
In the age of Cytheseus, where Cybernetics meets Theseus, humanity stands at a crossroads of unprecedented potential and profound ethical dilemmas. As we navigate the terrain of Cyborgization, armed with conceptual tools like Cytheseus, we embark on a quest to redefine the essence of humanity amidst the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
