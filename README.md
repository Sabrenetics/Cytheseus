# Title: Exploring Cytheseus: A Conceptual Framework for Understanding Cyborgization

## Abstract
Cytheseus, derived from Cybernetics and Theseus, amalgamates philosophical inquiry with ancient paradoxical musings. While Cybernetics delves into the study of systems encompassing man and machines, Theseus embodies the enigmatic Ship of Theseus, pondering over identity amidst perpetual reconstruction. Cytheseus bridges these domains, pondering the essence of humanity in an era of technologically augmented bodies. This paper introduces the concept of Cytheseus as a metric, quantifying the extent of human augmentation, akin to the Ship of Theseus's planks replaced over time. Through an exploration of Cyborgization, the paper investigates the convergence of organic and artificial components, elucidating its implications in science fiction and real-world innovations.

## Background
This open-source project in Biomedical Engineering aims to provide a comprehensive platform for creating 3D humanoid/animal models and exploring biomedical engineered technologies applicable to different parts of the body.

Cyberware, also known as biomedical engineered technologies, encompasses various technologies facilitating interaction between machines/computers and the human nervous system, including prosthetics, brain-computer interfaces, and medical instruments such as ECG heart rate readers. Biomedical Engineers collaborate with medical practitioners to enhance human capabilities by integrating, modifying, or replacing body parts, resulting in hybrid organisms known as cyborgs.

The motivation behind this project is to consolidate knowledge related to cyberware in an unbiased, open-source, and safe manner. Currently, such knowledge is often scattered across isolated research efforts in educational institutes, biomedical firms, and international institutions. By centralizing this research on Sabrenetics, we aim to create a single, regulated source of information accessible to the public and commercial organizations alike.

Users can explore different body parts and discover safe, curated biomedical engineered technologies. Contributions from users, including journal articles, enrich the database and expand the available options for cyberware.

Ultimately, Sabrenetics envisions hosting users' avatars (physical character models) on Sabrenetics.com, providing a centralized platform for storing, sharing, and modifying avatars. This ensures accessibility to research projects, personal endeavors, and commercial products, supported by Sabrenetics as a governing body.

The project encourages forking and modification for various purposes, including commercial ventures to advertise legal, safe, and regulated goods. It can also serve as a generic body modification software for fashion exploration or other scenarios unrelated to biomedical engineered technologies.

Cytheseus: Tracking Cyborgization

In addition to its role as a platform for exploring biomedical engineered technologies, this project introduces Cytheseus. Cytheseus serves as a metric for tracking the extent of human augmentation, inspired by the Ship of Theseus paradox. Users can track their "Cytheseus score," indicating the percentage of replaced or augmented body parts. This feature enhances the project's utility by offering users a personalized way to document their journey in human augmentation and cyborgization.

## Current alternatives
There is no clear alternative in the market that exists. Hence why Cytheseus was defined and created.

## Introduction
Cytheseus, a neologism born from the crossroads of Cybernetics and Theseus, seeks to navigate the complexities of human augmentation. Cybernetics, the study of systems, intertwines with the Ship of Theseus paradox, prompting reflection on the nature of identity amidst constant flux. In this paper, we embark on a journey to comprehend Cyborgization through the lens of Cytheseus, illuminating the blurred boundaries between man and machine.

## Cytheseus: Defining Human Augmentation
Cytheseus emerges as a conceptual framework, akin to a percentage, quantifying the extent of human augmentation. Drawing parallels to the Ship of Theseus, Cytheseus measures the proportion of replaced body parts, posing profound questions about the essence of humanity in a technologically driven world. Through hypothetical scenarios, we elucidate how Cytheseus varies based on the degree of augmentation, from minor enhancements to extensive biomechanical integration.

## Exploring Cyborgization
Building upon Cytheseus, we delve into Cyborgization as the process of integrating organic and artificial components to augment human capabilities. References from "The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction" underscore the multifaceted nature of Cyborgization, spanning from mental enhancements to radical biomechanical fusion. Through anecdotes from science fiction and real-world advancements, we unravel the intricate tapestry of Cyborgization, where the line between human and machine blurs with each innovation.

## Ethical Implications and Future Directions
As Cyborgization advances, ethical considerations loom large. Questions surrounding identity, autonomy, and societal norms demand careful deliberation. Moreover, as technology progresses, the possibilities for human augmentation expand exponentially, necessitating ongoing discourse and regulation. Looking ahead, Cytheseus serves as a compass, guiding ethical deliberations and shaping the trajectory of human enhancement.

## Conclusion
In the age of Cytheseus, where Cybernetics meets Theseus, humanity stands at a crossroads of unprecedented potential and profound ethical dilemmas. As we navigate the terrain of Cyborgization, armed with conceptual tools like Cytheseus, we embark on a quest to redefine the essence of humanity amidst the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
